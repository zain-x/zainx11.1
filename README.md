We'll send you an installation file within 2 days if you order it. Also, when you install it, it will say in the customer agreement that you aren't allowed to edit it. That just means you aren't allowed to edit it on your computer, but if you want to edit or contribute to it here, by all means do so! To contribute, just email us.
