# Zain X is a collection of programs similar to Microsoft Office, yet simpler and with less features because we've only been around since 2014. 
# Unlike regular versions of Zain X, we are commited to creating Zain X programs both for free and with less features making them good for computers with little storage or with little processing power.
# Our programs have always cost $5.99+, however this project aims to make a continuosly developing and changing, open source version.

# Update (002): Zain X Open is now constantly being worked on rather than being completed for every version of Zain X and therefore develops seperately.
--------------------------------------------
# Update (001): Zain X 11.1 FREE is now available via <a href="https://zainx.ecwid.com/#!/Zain-X-11-1-FREE/p/73068550/category=21102108">this site</a>. We'll send you an installation file within 2 days if you order it. Also, when you install it, it will say in the customer agreement that you aren't allowed to edit it. That just means you aren't allowed to edit it on your computer, but if you want to edit or contribute to it here, by all means please do so! To contribute, email us.
